NAME
    `Convert::Color::XTerm' - indexed colors used by mIRC

SYNOPSIS
    Directly:

     use Convert::Color::mIRC;

     my $red = Convert::Color::mIRC->new( 3 );

    Via Convert::Color:

     use Convert::Color;

     my $cyan = Convert::Color->new( 'mirc:11' )

DESCRIPTION
    This subclass of Convert::Color::RGB8 provides lookup of the colours
    that mIRC uses by default. Note that of course the module is not
    intelligent enough to be able to parse mIRC config, or know what
    palettes users are actually using, and thus it provides only an
    approximation of the likely behaviour of clients.

    The palette implemented consists of 16 colours, described as:

     0      1           2    3     4          5     6      7
     white  black       blue green red        brown purple orange

     8      9           10   11    12         13    14     15
     yellow light-green teal cyan  light-blue pink  grey   silver

CONSTRUCTOR
  $color = Convert::Color::mIRC->new( $index )
    Returns a new object to represent the color at that index.

METHODS
  $index = $color->index
    The index of the mIRC color.

TODO
    *   Find out if the embedded colour palette really is the default mIRC
        one, or update it if not. Patches welcome ;)
